I'm a bit of a theme park and coaster fan, so I thought why not build an app where you can find all the info you want on parks and coasters :-)
Also for the big coaster fans out there, a place to keep track of those all important coaster creds ;)

This is an ongoing project, and I will soon add the backend with all the data, and I still need to add the search functionality and a user functionality so users can login and track what coasters they've  been on. 
Built in React and Redux :-)
